# Project Obsidian - Cyber Threat Intelligence

## Overview

The Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) station provides essential training for anyone aspiring to enter the field of CTI. We cover the primary skills and concepts that CTI analysts need to understand and develop. Developing these skills and understanding these concepts will enable participants to better inform stakeholders and to operationalize CTI more effectively. We do this by integrating with other Project Obsidian stations during incident response simulations.

Understanding who might target your organization and why is a critical step that will enable stakeholders to prioritize cybersecurity investments and defend against threats.

## Module 1 - CTI Fundamentals

This module presents the fundamentals of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). CTI is a nuanced topic with a variety of applications. Therefore, it is important that we have the same understanding of terminology, concepts, goals and objectives, etc.

This module covers: 

- Terminology & Definitions
- Understanding Intelligence
- Types of CTI
- CTI Lifecycle
- Indicators of Compromise
- Collections Management Framework

### Objective

Simply put, the objective of module 1 is to understand the fundamentals of CTI.


## Module 2 - Threat Landscape (Know Thyself) - Coming Soon

Module 2 covers a standard way to create a threat landscape. We'll be creating a threat landscape for Magnum Tempus Financial, the fictious organization used for Project Obsidian.


## Module 3 - Generating Intelligence from an Incident

This module presents an overview of how threat intelligence can be generated from an incident and shared with various stakeholders. We'll run through an incident and demonstrate how the CTI team plays a critical role by performing research and providing valuable insights based on stakeholder requirements.

This module covers: 

- Direction & Planning: Overview of CTI stakeholders and intelligence requirements
- Collection: CTI analysts role during an incident
- Analysis & Production: Elements to include in a report
- Dissemination: Sharing the report with stakeholders
- Feedback & Evaluation: Methods for receiving feedback

### Objective

Demonstrate the critical role CTI plays both during and after an incident.

## Module 4 - Operationalizing Intelligence from an Intelligence Report

This module presents an overview of how threat intelligence gleaned from a single CTI report can be operationalized across an organization. We'll run through a report based on content from Project Obsidian's kill chain 3 and demonstrate how it can be operationlized by different teams (SOC, IR, forensics, security management, and executives.

This module covers:

- Direction & Planning: Establishing CTI goals and objectives 
- Collection: Objective is to review and operationalize a single CTI report
- Analysis & Production: Elements to identify in a CTI report
- Dissemination: Sharing takeaways from a CTI report with stakeholders
- Feedback & Evaluation: Methods for receiving feedback

### Objective

Demonstrate how a CTI report can be operationalized.
