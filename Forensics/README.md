#Simulated Attack Data (KC1 and KC3)
There are two attack simulations for the BTV DC30 Obsidian project.  They are named KC1, and KC3.  These are separate attack scenarios and can be analyzed as such.  We did some of the work for you (look in the analysis folders) - but purposely did not find everything.  We recommend that you use your own tools and look for what we missed.
